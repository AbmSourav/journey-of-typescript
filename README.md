Let's Learn TypeScript


## Installation

`npm install -g typescript`
JavaScript output: Go to `build` folder and run `node script.js`

Note: I run `tsc --init` from this folders and got `tsconfig.json`
Then changed `outDir` to `./build`. Now if I compile script.ts file with `tsc` then it'll put compiled JavaScript file in `./build` folder.
